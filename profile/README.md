# dagda - Social Network

**Dagda - Social Network** was born from the idea of [@d4viddf](https://github.com/D4vidDf) to create a social network where each user has control of the content they want to see and what content they want to publish.

The concept of the social network should be governed by the users themselves and not by algorithms that control the users' feed. Dagda gives users full control by allowing them to filter content by category and dividing their profile into different public or private feeds.
